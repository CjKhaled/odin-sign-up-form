<h1>Odin Sign Up Form</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a simple sign up form with input validation, created as part of the Odin project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The form is designed using HTML and styled with CSS, with client side validation (for passwords) implemented using JavaScript.
<h2>Features</h2>
There isn't much functionality besides some validation. Submit button does nothing.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
Building this form was good practice in HTML and CSS fundamentals. The most difficult aspect was recreating the look of the form with only a picture. Some things I'd like to improve on is adding realtime validation (Updating what needs to be changed as the user is typing). Overall, I had a great time developing this.
